# Computations of the edges of the CIM polytope

Computing the edge structure of a convex polytope is oftentimes a non-trivial task and the most commonly used algorithms for doing this scales very badly with dimension. Here we present an algorithm for polytopes that fulfill, or almost fulfill, the rhombus criterion.
